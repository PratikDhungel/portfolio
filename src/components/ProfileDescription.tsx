        Hi, I am Pratik Dhungel. I started my professional career in 2018 after a Bachelor of Computer Engineering
        degree from Kathmandu University the same year. Staring as a Quality Assurance Engineer, I shifted to Frontend
        Development after a couple of years.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        I bring in tons of experience working for multiple projects under service based companies as well as small team
        based startups. I am experienced in the industry standard development framework: Scrum, Kanban and Scrumban.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        As a QA, I was focused on application wide tests: UI, API as well as validation at database level. I also worked
        on automating test cases on both ends as well. Using tools like Robot Framework, Katalon Studio and later
        Cypress for the UI as well as automated API tests using Postman.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        Transitioning to development, I started with React for UI development and have been primarily focused with it. I
        have also worked on backend development mostly with Node and Express. Although I mostly focus on fronted
        development, I am comfortably working with backend APIs given my experience making tweaks and changes on APIs as
        required, but I would love to have more hands on experience as a backend developer as well.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2"></p>

      <p className="mb-2">
        Throughout the years, I have been part of multiple projects creating dashboards for various clients and worked
        on hospitality based domains, online e-signature platform as well as data visualization based platform. Most of
        the clients I have worked with are based off of the United States and hence I admire myself on having great
        communication.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Recently I was on a break after working with multiple teams and clients and looking to get back as a full stack
        engineer. I am working on my skills in the meantime, working on some NextJS, ReactNative, Node and Express
        projects. So if you are interested in having an experienced and well communicated developer as a part of your
        team, please feel free to react out to me through my LinkedIn or X (formerly Twitter) account.
